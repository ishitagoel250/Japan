        <h2 class="history-subheading">Early Japan</h2>
        <p class="history-para">During the BC era, the inhabitants of the Japanese islands were gatherers, fishers and hunters. In the 100BC, when rice culture was imported into Japan, agricultural was introduced. Land started to divide and social classes emerged. During the 400AD, a political center was created in and around the province of Yamato and was ruled by an emperor, but was soon taken over by the Soga clan. Buddhism was introduced around 550AD and was promoted by the ruling class. In 645, the era of the Fujiwara clan was started which was the last, until the rise of the military class (samurai) in the 11th century. The early Japan era lasted till the 710AD.</p>

      <div class="nara-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Nara and Heian Periods</h2>
        <p class="history-para">The Nara and Heian Period lasted till the 1192. Nara was the first Japanese capital established in the year 710. Large Buddhist monasteries were built in the new capital. In order to protect the position of the emperor and central government, the capital was moved to Nagaoka in 784, and finally to Heian (Kyoto) in 794 where it remained for over a thousand years. Chinese influence declined over time in Japan. Kana syllables were developed which made the creation of actual Japanese literature possible. <br>
        However, due to failures in the land and taxation reforms, the political power steadily shifted from the central government to the large independent land owners. The Fujiwara family controlled the political scene of the Heian period over several centuries through strategic intermarriages with the imperial family. In 1016, public order could not be maintained because the  the ability of the Fujiwara leaders began to decline. Thus, many land owners hired samurai for the protection of their properties. That is how the military class became more and more influential.<br>
        After a series of wars, Minamoto Yoritomo, who was from a military family with aristocratic background, gained the supremacy of Japan and became it's leader.

      <div class="kamakura-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Kamakura Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">In 1199, quarrels for supremacy started between the Kamakura Bakufu and the Imperial court in Kyoto. It ended in the Jokyu disturbance in 1221 when Kamakura defeated the Imperial army in Kyoto. They redistributed the land gained during the Jokyu disturbance and achieved loyalty among all the powerful people throughout the country.<br>
        By 1259, the Mongols had conquered China and became also interested in Japan. The first Mongol invasion attempt was in 1274 but the naval invasion fleet was forced to retreat due to bad weather conditions. Due to good preparations, the Japanese were able to maintain a strong defence for several weeks during a second invasion attempt which occurred in 1281. But again, the Mongols were finally forced to withdraw mainly because of bad weather. Soon the Mongols soon had too many problems on the mainland in order to care about Japan.<br>
        The consequences of the many years of war preparations against the Mongols were fatal to the Kamakura government since they resulted only in expenditures and no profits. Financial problems and decreasing loyalty among the powerful lords lead to the fall of the Kamakura government. By 1333 the power of the Hojo regents had declined to such a degree that the emperor Go-Daigo was able to restore imperial power and overthrow the Kamakura Bakufu.

      <div class="muromachi-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Muromachi Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">Ashikaga Takauji who was once fighting for the emperor, had now challenged the imperial court, after emperor Go-Daigo was able to restore imperial power, and succeeded in capturing Kyoto in 1336.<br>
        Two imperial courts existed in Japan for over 50 years, the Southern and Northern courts. They fought many battles against each other. The Northern court usually was in a more advantageous position, nevertheless, the South succeeded in capturing Kyoto several times for short time periods resulting in the destruction of the capital on a regular basis. The Southern court finally gave in in 1392, and the country became emperor-wise reunited again.<br>
        In 1542 the first Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries arrived in Kyushu, and introduced firearms and christianity to Japan. By the middle of the 16th century, several of the most powerful warlords were competing for control over the whole country. One of them was Oda Nobunaga. He made the first big steps towards unification of Japan by capturing Kyoto in 1568 and overthrowing the Muromachi bakufu in 1573.

      <div class="azuchi-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Azuchi-Momoyama Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">Oda Nobunaga achieved control over the province of Owari. After establishing himself in Kyoto, Nobunaga continued to eliminate his enemies. However, in 1582, general Akechi murdered Nobunaga and captured his Azuchi castle. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a general fighting for Nobunaga, reacted very quickly, defeated Akechi, and took over control. Hideyoshi continued to eliminate remaining rivals and after defeating the Hojo family in Odawara in 1590, Japan was finally reunited.<br>
        In order to bring the country under absolute control, Hideyoshi destroyed many castles, confiscated the weapons of all the farmers and religious institutions, and forbade the samurai to be active as farmers and forced them to move into the castle towns. In 1587, Hideyoshi issued an edict expelling Christian missionaries. As a result, foreign traders and missionaries acted aggressively towards native Japanese institutions.<br>
        After uniting the country, Hideyoshi's armies invaded Korea and captured Seoul. However, in the following year, they were pushed back by Chinese and Korean forces. Hideyoshi stubbornly didn't give in until the final evacuation from Korea in 1598, the same year in which he died. Tokugawa Ieyasu, who had been an intelligent partner of Hideyoshi and Nobunaga, succeeded Hideyoshi as the most powerful man of Japan.

      <div class="edo-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Edo Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">Tokugawa Ieyasu did not respect Hideyoshi's successor Hideyori because he wanted to become the absolute ruler of Japan. In the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Ieyasu defeated the Hideyori loyalists and other Western rivals. Hence, he achieved almost unlimited power and wealth. In 1603, Ieyasu was appointed Shogun by the emperor and established his government in Edo (Tokyo).<br>
        In 1615, when Ieyasu captured Osaka Castle, he and his successors had practically no rivals left, and peace prevailed throughout the Edo period. Therefore, the samurai were educating themselves not only in the martial arts but also in literature, philosophy and arts.<br>
        The most important philosophy of Tokugawa Japan was Neo-Confucianism, a strict four class system. At the top of the social hierarchy stood the samurai, followed by the peasants, artisans and merchants. The members of the four classes were not allowed to change their social status. Outcasts, people with professions that were considered impure, formed a fifth class.<br>
        The positon of the Tokugawa government was steadily declining due to worsening of financial situation of the government, leading to higher taxes and riots and natural disasters and years of famine. The social hierarchy began to break down as the merchant class grew increasingly powerful while some samurai became financially dependent of them. In the second half of the era, corruption, incompetence and a decline of morals within the government caused further problems.<br>
        All factors combined, the anti-government feelings were growing and caused other movements such as the demand for the restoration of imperial power and anti western feelings. In 1867-68, the Tokugawa government fell because of heavy political pressure, and the power of Emperor Meiji was restored.

      <div class="meiji-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Meiji Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">In 1867/68, the Tokugawa era found an end in the Meiji Restoration. The emperor Meiji was moved from Kyoto to Tokyo and his imperial power was restored. The political power was transferred from the Tokugawa Bakufu into the hands of a small group of nobles and former samurai.<br>
        The Japanese were forced to sign unequal treaties with Western powers. The new government aimed to make Japan a democratic state with equality among all its people. The boundaries between the social classes of Tokugawa Japan were gradually broken down. Consequently, the samurai were the big losers of those social reforms since they lost all their privileges. The reforms also included the establishment of human rights such as religious freedom in 1873. The education system was reformed after the French and later after the German system.<br>
        In order to transform the agrarian economy of Tokugawa Japan into a developed industrial one, many Japanese scholars were sent abroad to study Western science and languages, while foreign experts taught in Japan. The large expenditures led to a financial crisis in the middle of the 1880's which was followed by a reform of the currency system and the establishment of the Bank of Japan. The textile industry grew fastest.On the political sector, Japan received its first European style constitution in 1889.<br>
        Conflicts of interests in Korea between China and Japan led to the Sino-Japanese War in 1894-95. Japan defeated China, received Taiwan, but was forced by Russia, France and Germany to return other territories. New conflicts of interests in Korea and Manchuria led to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-05. In 1912 emperor Meiji died, and the era of the ruling clique of elder statesmen (genro) was about to end.

      <div class="taisho-period">
        <h2 class="history-subheading">Taisho and Early Showa Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">In the First World War, Japan joined the Allied powers, but played only a minor role in fighting German colonial forces in East Asia. After WW1, Japan's economical situation worsened. During the 1930s, the military established almost complete control over the government.<br>
        In 1933, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations since she was heavily criticized for her actions in China. In July 1937, the second Sino-Japanese War broke out. In 1940, Japan occupied French Indochina (Vietnam) upon agreement with the French Vichy government, and joined the Axis powers Germany and Italy. These actions intensified Japan's conflict with the United States and Great Britain which reacted with an oil boycott.<br>
        In December 1941, Japan attacked the Allied powers at Pearl Harbor. On July 27, 1945, the Allied powers requested Japan in the Potsdam Declaration to surrender unconditionally, or destruction would continue. On August 14, however, Emperor Showa finally decided to surrender unconditionally.

        <h2 class="history-subheading">Postwar Period</h2>
        <p class="history-para">After World War II had ended, Japan was devastated. All the large cities (with the exception of Kyoto), the industries and the transportation networks were severely damaged. A severe shortage of food continued for several years.<br>
        A new constitution went into effect in 1947: The emperor lost all political and military power, and was solely made the symbol of the state. Universal suffrage was introduced and human rights were guaranteed. Japan was also forbidden to ever lead a war again or to maintain an army.<br>
        Japan's Self Defence Force was established in 1954, accompanied by large public demonstrations. After the Korean War, and accelerated by it, the recovery of Japan's economy flourished.
